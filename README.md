# Currency converter App

> [Assignment](./ASSIGMENT.md)

## Commands

- Install: `yarn install`;
- Develop: `yarn serve`;
- Build: `yarn build`;
- Test: `yarn test`

## Decisions

- SSR app because I want to leverage from converting this to a progressive web app.
  - I've worked before with Next.JS and it can be flexible enough to go from a Client side rendered app to a fully server side rendered app. (Proficiency)
  - Future features availability. (Potential)
  - Chakra UI because of accessibility and documentation wise it's very easy to follow.
  - I introduce acceptance tests at an earlier stage to allow some refactoring.

## Roadmap
